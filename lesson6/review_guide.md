### Protect your brand: A checklist for legal influencer marketing

Regulating bodies, like the FTC in the United States or ASAS in Singapore, are tasked with
ensuring that brands, advertising agencies, and influencers do not deceive consumers with
influencer marketing.

Your legal requirements will vary based on your country and industry, so you’ll need to do some
research to get familiar with the relevant requirements.

about influencer marketing laws around the world.

Follow these tips to keep your influencer marketing campaign above board:

1. Be upfront about disclosure
- Disclosure rules can vary, but if you are paying for influencer promotion, you
should find a way to let people know. In the US, FTC rules require that posts
need to be labeled “clearly and conspicuously.”

2. Define the content rights upfront
- Ownership of content:
   - The influencer usually owns any content that is distributed through
their own channels (even if a brand pays for it).

- Usage rights:
   - Content created by influencers may have to be removed from your
brand’s social channels after a certain period of time. Also, the content
may not be able to be repurposed and featured on TV or other media
channels. 
3. Know your category
- Laws and legal standards can vary widely from industry to industry.
   - Pharma brands, for example, often require their influencers to disabl comments, because influencers are usually not equipped to respond to medical questions from fans.

4. Lean on your legal team
- Your legal department may not be used to the uncertainty that comes with an
outside party distributing your branded content, but be patient and work
together!
5. Be clear about exclusivity
- “Exclusivity” means that the influencers you work with will not work with any of
your competitors for a certain period of time. Never take exclusivity for granted!

6. Define take down rights
- Clearly express whether it’s okay for an influencer to take down content at any
point (and, if so, when).

7. Keep it real
- Never create fake profiles to interact with or comment on influencers’ posts.

What happens if my influencer campaign is overrun by negative comments?
Get involved! Respond with something that will allow you to learn more about what your
customers didn’t like, so you can change your campaigns in the future.

If you’re working with an agency or MCN, they should be up to date on the laws relevant to
your country and industry. Always do your homework, and speak to your legal team.
