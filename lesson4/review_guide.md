### MEASURING YOUR INFLUENCER CAMPAIGN

How much should you pay an influencer?

- Most marketers pay influencers a set fee per post, as opposed to a cost per click or cost
per acquisition model.
- According to research from Digiday, here are influencer cost estimates for three popular
platforms:
   *  Instagram: $1,000 per 100,000 followers
   *  Snapchat: $500 for 1,000-5,000 views (in 24 hours)
   *  YouTube: Roughly $2,000 per 100,000 followers
Payment can also vary depending on the type of influencer.

- Celebrity or Top-Tier Influencer:
   *  Generally, a flat (and steep!) fee
- “Magic Middle” or Micro-Influencer:
   *  You will likely pay on a per-post basis
- Key Opinion Leader or Brand Advocate
   *  You can pay these folks to create content or appear at events, or you can give
them free products or unique experiences worth sharing with their audience

How will I tie my influencer campaign back to a return on investment?

- Awareness
   *  To measure exposure, look to impressions to count how many times your
content was seen and to unique visits to count how many individuals saw your
content.
   *  To measure Brand Lift, you can partner with vendors like Millward Brown,
Kantar, or Nielsen to determine the campaign’s impact.

- Interest
   *  To measure engagement use one of the following formulas:

   *  To track brand mentions, you can set up a Google Alert that includes your brand,
   or use any of the platforms listed here:
      - SocialMention
      - Trackur

      - Netbase
      - Simply Measured
      - Union Metrics
      - Brandwatch
      - Coosto
- Conversions
   *  Measure with tracking pixels to link ad exposures to conversions and even in-
store purchases.
   *  UTMs can track click-through activity to your site, but are limited on platforms
that do not offer click-through behavior like Instagram and Snapchat.
   *  Personalized promo codes and coupons are a great alternative to UTMs to track
the impact of your campaign because they also create a sense of urgency.
   *  Lastly, you can measure sales lift by correlating your sales or app installs with the
time your influencer campaign was posted.

- Brand Advocacy
   *  One of your campaign goals may be to turn influencers into loyal brand
advocates, which can be especially powerful if you work in a B2B or smaller
industry where there are fewer choices.
   *  To measure this impact, send influencers a survey a few months after the
campaign to find out about their continued usage of your product. You might
include the question used to calculate NPS.

- A final note for measuring your influencer campaigns: Always be learning!
   *  Analyze the campaign’s performance, read the comments, and even ask the
   influencer for tips on how to improve your next campaign!
