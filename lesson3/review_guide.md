### CREATING AN INFLUENCER CAMPAIGN BRIEF

To set your campaign up for success, provide your collaborators with a comprehensive brief in
order to clearly state campaign, legal, and ownership requirements and avoid any potential
pitfalls.
An exceptional campaign brief will provide clarity around the project, by setting clear
expectations and objectives, while still allowing the influencer the creative space to stay true to
their voice and authentic to their audience. 
[Here](assets/InfluencerBriefTemplate.pptx) is a campaign brief template for you to use.

Remember, this is only a template! You don’t need to have all the answers completed before
you share it, as your partner can help guide your strategy and complete your campaign.

### When creating your brief, remember to:

- Set goals and strategy
- Think audience first
- Include detailed information relating to tone, your brand, and styling elements
- Highlight milestone dates and deadlines!
- Include regulatory compliance information (i.e. FTC or ASAS)
- Entice influencers with your brand’s social reach
