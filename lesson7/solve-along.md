### Slideshow

_Slide Title_: The Situation:

_Slide Title_: What would you do?

Given the strategy, goals, and target market, how might you use influencers for this campaign?

1. Have up and coming YouTube stars create funny videos where they used the razors to shave in public

2. Target influencers in their target audience’s real lives - their relationship partners - with Facebook ads aimed at incentivizing them to convince their partner to try the razor

3. Engage Instagram micro-influencers with a niche following related to mustache culture to participate in a “Reverse Movember” where instead of growing a mustache for a month, they shaved it off for a month

_Slide Title_: The Strategy:

Wilkinson Sword and their agency, The Social Partners, targeted women who were in relationships with bearded men with “highly targeted” ads promoting an opportunity to win a free trial of the product.

These ads also promoted an opportunity to win a joint style makeover, which was highly effective in driving submissions and collecting emails.

_Slide Title_: What would you do?

How would you, as Wilkinson Sword, leverage the submissions for the free trial and entry into the makeover promotion to extend your campaign?

1. Send everyone who entered one additional free razor for each post they publish mentioning Wilkinson Sword

2. Use the email addresses of the women who submitted entries into the contest to target everyone in their networks with additional ads

3. Identify the top style influencers from the submissions, and incentivize these individuals to post about them by counting each post about the razor as an entry to win the style makeover.

_Slide Title_: The Survey:

Wilkinson Sword and Social partners asked the entrants to complete an in-depth survey to identify who were the most influential participants of the group. They asked each entrant questions to discover:

* the level of social influence he had
* the degree to which he looked to partners and peers for affirmation on his style.
* how often he posted about products and services
* how often he met up with friends
* his social media presence and usage

They identified the top 1,000 influential entrants based on this survey, and sent them the new razor. They also encouraged these influencers to share their experiences and new styles they had created with the razor on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, in exchange for an opportunity to win the style makeover.

But they didn’t forget about the product itself - they also used regular surveys to gain feedback on the product feature claims, helping refine their messaging.
