### EIGHT WAYS TO RUIN AN INFLUENCER RELATIONSHIP

Remember that influencers are people, too. Many marketers think too short-term when it
comes to influencers. Instead, try to develop lasting relationships so that your influencers
can turn into brand advocates!

Watch out for these 8 Influencer Relationship Pitfalls:

1. Not knowing what you want
- If a potential influencer senses that your campaign is disorganized and poorly
planned, it’s possible that they will simply turn any offer you make them
- If you do change course, be sure to
   1.  Communicate any changes to your influencers promptly and succinctly.
   1.  Address any budgetary discrepancies the changes may cause.
   1.  Make sure there is someone available to answer influencers’ questions.

2. Failing to think through all costs in advance
- It’s essential to be clear about what influencers will receive in exchange for their
role in promoting your brand online.
- Make sure you address all relevant questions about payment in your contract,
and be ready to negotiate.

3. Having unrealistic timelines
- If an influencer feels that you’re demanding too much from them in too little
time, they’ll simply regard you as a short-term revenue source, as opposed to a
potential long-term partner. 

4. Being impersonal or transactional
- When first contacting an influencer, you might:
   -  Comment on a post you loved
   -  Mention a shared interest
   -  Explain why you think your brand and theirs are aligned
- Even after a campaign is over, reaching out to influencers periodically to check in
is a good idea, especially if you plan on working with them again in the future.

5. Trying to own their voice
- If you try to micromanage the creative process, not only do you risk losing an
influencer’s stake in the project, but you could also end up with disingenuous
content. 
- Once the campaign brief has been agreed on, it’s best to step away and trust the
influencer.

6. Forgetting to show appreciation
- Brand advocates are made through positive reinforcement. Send a thank you
note or let your influencers know that you would like to work with them in the
future.

7. Blurring the legal lines
- Your brand is responsible for knowing the ins and outs of any relevant
laws. Make sure you communicate legal guidelines to influencers clearly.

8. Expect them to save you from yourself
- If you don’t have a good product-market fit, you’re probably better off going
back to the drawing board and improving the product, rather than trying to
make it successful with influencer marketing.

Building a community of influencers is a great way to foster long-term relationships with your
brand, and it gives influencers the chance to bounce ideas off each other.
